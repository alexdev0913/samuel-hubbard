Another approach is to use simple hand soap and water on a facecloth or sponge and wash the upper leather. After washing it is best to allow the shoes to dry in the air. It is never recommended to use heat to dry leather as it tends to stiffen the leather.<\/p><p>Oil stains on nubuck and suede are stubborn and are difficult to remove. If you happen to get a stain on your shoes (especially oil or grease), try to blot with whatever absorbent material is handy. Sooner is better as the stain may sink in. DO NOT use water as it may cause the stain to set. Sprinkle the stain with baby powder or any kind of talcum or chalk. DO NOT rub it in, but simply let it sit on the surface. Let it sit overnight and then lightly brush it off in the morning. Then you can use a nubuck\/suede brush, or any stiff brush such as a nail brush.<\/p><p>If there is still a stain, you can try using a commercial degreaser. If this leaves the stained area lighter, you might consider applying the baby powder and degreaser across the entire shoe.<\/p><p>Another technique is to use an abrasive cleaning eraser, just as you would use a gum eraser on paper. It is a good idea to finish the cleaning with the nubuck\/suede stiff brush.<\/p>"

It is a doubly tanned leather that is first drum-dyed as a yellow leather and then has a blue tanning dye applied to the surface. It is this special tanning that gives your shoes the unique look with the yellow edges where the leather has been cut.<\/p><p>The navy blue can become somewhat faded and we have found a blue spray dye that can restore the color of the leather. We will be happy to send this dye to you with our compliments if you contact Customer Service at support@samuelhubbard.com or (844) 482.4800 Monday through Friday, 7AM - 5PM PT.

              "answer": "<p>The leather in these shoes is called oil-tanned, pull-up leather. The leather is impregnated with oils when it is tanned, producing a leather that is extremely strong and with certain waterproof characteristics, although it is not technically waterproof.<\/p><p>Over time the oil in the leather will work its way to the surface and you will notice that the shoes tend to get darker in color, except in the creases caused by flexing. Also, a scratch on the surface will leave a lighter area. Some people call this a \"distressed look\" and think of it as rugged and real looking. If you prefer to smooth out the coloration of the shoe to a more uniform appearance, we suggest using a brush.<\/p>"
